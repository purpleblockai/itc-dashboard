- **Coverage Method 2**: Available Pincodes / Serviceable Pincodes
  - Direct measure of available products in serviceable areas

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
# MongoDB Connection String
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/your-database?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# NextAuth Secret
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret-key

# Optional - The base URL of your site
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Set to true to enable admin access when creating the first user
ENABLE_FIRST_USER_ADMIN=true
```

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd E-Com-Dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up MongoDB:
   - Create a MongoDB database (either locally or using MongoDB Atlas)
   - Replace the `MONGODB_URI` in your `.env.local` file with your connection string

4. Initialize admin user:
   ```bash
   node scripts/init-admin.js
   ```
   This will create an admin user with:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: admin123
   
   **Important**: Change the password immediately after first login.

5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access the application.

## Production Deployment

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
```

Start the production server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start

pnpm start
```
